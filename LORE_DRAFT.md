# Lore Concepts for "Galaga-like" Project

Here are three potential storylines for the game.

## Concept 1: The Chrono-Splinter
**Genre:** Sci-Fi / Time Travel
**Premise:** The "invaders" are not aliens, but a desperate, militaristic version of humanity from a dying future. They have fractured the timeline to invade the past (our present) and steal Earth's pristine resources. The "enemy ships" are glitches in reality—flickering, distorted amalgams of futuristic tech and historical war machines.
**The Pilot:** You fly the *Epoch*, a prototype craft designed to repair space-time rifts.
**Tone:** Desperate, glitchy, high-tech.

## Concept 2: The Silicon Mycelium
**Genre:** Cyber-Horror / Bio-punk
**Premise:** A biomechanical fungal spore has drifted into the solar system. It consumes metal and silicon, turning satellites, space stations, and defense fleets into "zombified" constructs. The "aliens" look like standard ships but twisted with pulsing organic growths and tendrils.
**The Pilot:** You are not a human. You are *Aegis*, an ancient defense AI uploaded into a drone chassis, the only thing immune to the biological infection.
**Tone:** Creepy, organic, neon-green and rust.

## Concept 3: The Star-Eaters
**Genre:** Cosmic Horror / Arcade Classic
**Premise:** Massive, localized black holes with sentience—"Void Whales"—have entered the sector. They don't attack directly; they shed "parasites" (the enemies) that harvest energy to feed the Whales. If the Whales feed enough, they will swallow the sun.
**The Pilot:** A deep-space miner whose laser drills have been overclocked into weapons.
**Tone:** Epic, colorful, arcade-style energy weapons against dark, void-like enemies.
