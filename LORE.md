# The Chrono-Splinter: Full Lore Bible

## The Setting

**Year:** 2347 (The Future) / 2087 (The Present)

In the year 2347, Earth is dying. A faction called **The Continuance** has fractured spacetime to invade the past (2087) and strip-mine its resources. They started at Mercury and spread across the entire solar system.
